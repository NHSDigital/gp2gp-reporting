        The data is updated monthly, 14 days after the end of the month, so that
        we can identify whether transfers initiated on the last day of the month
        were integrated within the 8 day SLA. There may be some transfers that
        have been initiated in this time period and will be integrated in the
        future, which will not be represented in this data.
