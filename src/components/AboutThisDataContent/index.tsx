    <p>
      This site is updated 14 days after the end of each month. This is to
      identify whether transfers started at the end of the month were integrated
      within 8 days. When records are not integrated within 8 days, GP2GP
      requests that a full paper copy is printed and sent to the practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every transfer shown on the platform is categorised 14 days after it
      started. For example, a transfer started on the 2nd February would be
      categorised based on its status on the 15th February.
